//Q:An n-bit gray code sequence is a sequence of 2n integers where:

//Every integer is in the inclusive range [0, 2n - 1],
//The first integer is 0,
//An integer appears no more than once in the sequence,
//The binary representation of every pair of adjacent integers differs by exactly one bit, and
//The binary representation of the first and last integers differs by exactly one bit.
//Given an integer n, return any valid n-bit gray code sequence.
//Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/gray-code/

 Example 1:

//Input: n = 2
//Output: [0,1,3,2]
//Explanation:
//The binary representation of [0,1,3,2] is [00,01,11,10].
//- 00 and 01 differ by one bit
//- 01 and 11 differ by one bit
//- 11 and 10 differ by one bit
//- 10 and 00 differ by one bit
//[0,2,3,1] is also a valid gray code sequence, whose binary representation is [00,10,11,01].
//- 00 and 10 differ by one bit
//- 10 and 11 differ by one bit
//- 11 and 01 differ by one bit
//- 01 and 00 differ by one bit
//Example 2:

//Input: n = 1
//Output: [0,1]
